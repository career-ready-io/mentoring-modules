      <h2>Someone Else</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="/">Dann Petty</a> is a well-known freelance designer who
        specializes in designing websites and apps for big companies like
        Google, Airbnb, North Face, and Uber, just to name a few. What I love
        about his website is how well the homepage works. First, there’s a
        strong statement at the top letting you know exactly what kind of design
        work he specializes in. He hints at past client work with the live
        updating text for companies like “Airbnb” to “Uber” and more. There’s a
        beautiful gallery of work below to scroll through to get a sense of his
        past work and how what he can do for the next client that comes along.
